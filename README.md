# next-saas-notes-app

## Getting Started

To bootstrap a Next.js app fast, type `npx create-next-app`. 

To do it manually, do this: 

`npm init -y`

Then:

`npm i next react react-dom -S`

### Scripts

`npm run dev` runs Next.js, in dev mode.
`npm run build` gets it ready for production
`npm run start` runs that build.


### Routing

Next.js comes out of the box with some conventions around routing. In particular, anything in the pages folder will render at the route the filename has.
